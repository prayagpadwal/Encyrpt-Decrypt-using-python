# Encyrpt-Decrypt-using-python

If the user chooses to encrypt the message, the userâ€™s message must be transformed into a secret code. But if the user chooses to decrypt the message, your program should be able to convert a secret code into a meaningful text.

For this task, you must write a program that rearranges the order of letters in user input so that it cannot be understood by anyone. This can be done by putting the letters in even and odd positions.

Then we have to swap the first two letters with the next two and so on. The code to convert encrypted text to decrypted text can be done by reversing the letters according to user input.
